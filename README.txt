Problem 1: slp.sml
Problem 2: SymTblFct.sml
Problem 3: btree.sml

Textual response:
2.2.c
  Since we used the initializer for Sym functor twice rather than using the initializer once and passing the instance generated by the initializer to two other initializers. The actual instances generated by twice calling of SymFct() are different. Thus, the instances which passed to the initializer for SymTblFct and the initializer for LexFct are not the same structure instance 'Sym'. This would cause that the interpreter errors in unmatched type.
